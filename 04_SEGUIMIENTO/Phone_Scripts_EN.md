# PHONE FOLLOW-UP SCRIPTS - GASWORX TAMPA

## GENERAL SCRIPT - ENGLISH

### 1. GREETING AND INTRODUCTION (15 seconds)
"Good morning/afternoon, am I speaking with [NAME]?"
"This is Rosa Gonz√°lez from Luxury House Keep Up."
"I sent you an email this week regarding our post-construction cleaning services for the Gasworx project, and I wanted to follow up to see if you had a chance to review our proposal."

### 2. REINFORCE VALUE AND URGENCY (30 seconds)
"I know you're in the delivery phase and we want to help ensure every space is spotless and ready on schedule."
"We have teams ready, fully insured, and experienced with large projects like Gasworx."
"We're offering a trial cleaning at a special rate, with no commitment, so you can evaluate our quality first-hand."

### 3. CREATE IMMEDIATE ACTION (20 seconds)
"We actually have availability this week to visit the site and provide a free evaluation."
"Would tomorrow morning or afternoon work better for you to take measurements and provide you with a quote within 24 hours?"

### 4. COMMON OBJECTION RESPONSES

**If they say "send me more information":**
"Absolutely, I can resend the email with our presentation sheet and before/after photos. Can I confirm your email address? [PAUSE] Perfect, I'll send that right now. Should I call you tomorrow to see if you have any questions?"

**If they say "not a good time right now":**
"I completely understand. Would it work better if we scheduled something for next week? That way we can secure availability in our schedule for when you're ready."

**If they say "we already have a provider":**
"That's great to hear you're already covered. Would you mind if I keep you in our database for future projects? It never hurts to have backup options."

**If they say "too expensive":**
"I understand your concern. That's exactly why we offer the pilot trial, so you can compare our quality-to-price ratio. Often the initial cost is offset by the speed and quality that prevents rework."

### 5. FRIENDLY CLOSE (10 seconds)
"Perfect, we're set for [DAY/TIME]. I'll send you confirmation by email and we'll see you at the site."
"Thank you very much for your time and have a great day."
