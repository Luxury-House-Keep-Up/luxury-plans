SUBJECT: Corporate Office Cleaning Services â€“ Gasworx Development

Dear Jim,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Rosa GonzÃ¡lez, and I represent Luxury House Keep Up, a specialized post-construction and corporate cleaning service serving the Tampa Bay area.

Given JLL's reputation for excellence in office leasing and your involvement with the Gasworx project, I wanted to introduce our services that can help ensure office spaces meet the high standards your corporate clients expect.

We understand that JLL's corporate tenants require pristine, professional environments from day one, and our post-construction cleaning services are designed to deliver exactly that level of quality.

OUR CORPORATE-FOCUSED SERVICES:
â€¢ Complete post-construction cleaning to corporate standards
â€¢ Deep cleaning of all office surfaces, windows, and common areas
â€¢ Preparation for corporate move-ins and furniture installation
â€¢ Ongoing maintenance programs available
â€¢ Full insurance coverage meeting corporate requirements
â€¢ Bilingual team for diverse tenant needs

EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR JLL/GASWORX:
We'd like to offer a complimentary evaluation and trial cleaning for one of your upcoming office deliveries, demonstrating our commitment to the quality standards JLL and your corporate tenants expect.

Our team has extensive experience with corporate environments and understands the importance of maintaining professional standards throughout the cleaning process.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how we can support JLL's success at Gasworx and potentially other Tampa projects.

Could we schedule a brief meeting this week to explore this partnership opportunity?

Best regards,

Rosa GonzÃ¡lez
