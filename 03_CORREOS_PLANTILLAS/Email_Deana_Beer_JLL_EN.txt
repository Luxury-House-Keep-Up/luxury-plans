SUBJECT: Office Space Preparation Services â€“ Gasworx Development Support

Dear Deana,

I hope you're having a great week. My name is Rosa GonzÃ¡lez from Luxury House Keep Up, a specialized post-construction cleaning service that works with office leasing teams throughout Tampa Bay.

I'm reaching out because we understand the challenges JLL faces in delivering office spaces that meet corporate tenant expectations, and we'd like to support your leasing success at Gasworx.

Clean, move-in ready office spaces are crucial for successful tenant tours and can significantly impact leasing velocity - something I'm sure you experience regularly in your role.

HOW WE SUPPORT OFFICE LEASING SUCCESS:
â€¢ Post-construction cleaning to corporate presentation standards
â€¢ Rapid turnaround for last-minute tenant tours
â€¢ Deep cleaning of all office areas, windows, and building common spaces
â€¢ Coordination with your leasing schedule and tenant move-in dates
â€¢ Professional appearance and conduct during tenant-present cleaning
â€¢ Full insurance and bonding for corporate environments

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
We'd like to offer JLL a trial cleaning service for one of your upcoming Gasworx office deliveries, allowing you to experience our quality and reliability in supporting your leasing goals.

Our team understands the fast-paced nature of commercial leasing and can adapt our schedule to support your tenant tours and move-in requirements.

Would you have time for a brief conversation this week about how we can support JLL's continued success at Gasworx?

Best regards,

Rosa GonzÃ¡lez
