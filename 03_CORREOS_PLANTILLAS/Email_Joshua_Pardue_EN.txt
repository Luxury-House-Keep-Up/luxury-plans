SUBJECT: Post-Construction Cleaning Services â€“ Gasworx Office Spaces (Tampa)

Dear Joshua,

My name is Rosa GonzÃ¡lez, and I represent Luxury House Keep Up, a specialized post-construction cleaning service for commercial and residential developments in the Tampa Bay area.

Understanding your role in leasing and space management within Gasworx, I wanted to reach out regarding our post-construction cleaning services that can help ensure office and commercial spaces are delivered in pristine condition for your tenants.

As you know, first impressions matter significantly in leasing, and clean, move-in ready spaces can accelerate occupancy rates and tenant satisfaction.

OUR SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL SPACES:
â€¢ Comprehensive post-construction cleanup including dust, debris, and paint residue removal
â€¢ Deep cleaning of all surfaces, windows, and flooring systems
â€¢ Preparation for tenant build-outs and move-ins
â€¢ Flexible scheduling to accommodate construction timelines
â€¢ Full insurance coverage and professional equipment

SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR GASWORX:
We'd like to offer a trial cleaning service at a special rate for one of your upcoming space deliveries, allowing you to evaluate our quality and reliability without any long-term commitment.

Our team understands the unique requirements of office spaces and commercial environments, and we can work around your leasing schedule to ensure spaces are ready for tenant tours and move-ins.

Attached you'll find our service overview and pricing information.

Would you be available for a brief site visit this week to discuss how we can support Gasworx's leasing success?

Best regards,

Rosa GonzÃ¡lez
